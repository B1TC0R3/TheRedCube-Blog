# HTB University CTF 2021

In November 2021, we managed to participate in the University CTF organized by Hack The Box. It is one, if not the biggest, competition for university teams. With 10 participants, we managed to join the competition, which took place over the weekend.

We had the great opportunity to meet onsite at the University with regard to the Covid-19 precautions. This was a great time to work together over the weekend on intense challenges.

Back then, we participated under the name *scriptkiddie2012* and placed 50 out of 253 participating teams.
