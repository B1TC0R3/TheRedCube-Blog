# HTB University CTF 2023

The University CTF was great for us. Right before Christmas, we had a great time working together for a weekend, meeting at the university to solve the various challenges.

This was our third year of participation. It was an exhausting but rewarding CTF.

We joined the CTF under the name **HM TheRedCube** as only universities are allowed to participate, and we managed to reach 73th place out of 417 participating teams.
