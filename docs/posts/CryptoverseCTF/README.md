# Cryptoverse CTF

Cryptoverse was a great opportunity for us to meet at the University over the weekend and welcome many students who had first joined a CTF. It's great for us if there is a high bar or no limit on the team participants so new players can join and try out working on a CTF challenge.

Specifically, in our recent experience at Cryptoverse, we dealt with various intriguing challenges and puzzles, which tested our skills in programming, cryptography, reverse engineering, web/server exploits, and other forms of knowledge and abilities.

We worked our way up to 42nd place and had a great time at the CTF. It was an exhausting but rewarding experience, and we look forward to participating in it again next year.
