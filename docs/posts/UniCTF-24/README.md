# HTB University CTF 2024

As it has become a tradition at HM, we joined the University CTF this year again. Over 25 Students were involved in the CTF over the weekend from December 13 to 15. It was a great CTF for beginners who were playing for the first time and also for experienced CTF players who found some good challenges to tackle.

Big thanks to all those who participated, especially [Prof. Dr. Peter Trapp](https://hm.edu/kontakte_de/contact_detail_32577.de.html), who organized our team and made sure we had everything we needed to attend.

We joined the CTF under the name **HM TheRedCube** as only universities are allowed to participate, and we managed to reach **46th place out of 872 participating teams**.
