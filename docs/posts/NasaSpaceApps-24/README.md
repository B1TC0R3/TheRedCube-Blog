# NASA Space Apps Hackathon (Nuremberg)

## Exosky!

Looking deep into the night sky at earth is a magical moment with all the stars in the sky and maybe also reflected at a nearby lake.

Sometimes it's just fun to relax and enjoy; but ever wondered what the sky looks like from a different star (more precisely, an exoplanet)?

Our team set out and created a simulation to view the universe from the perspective of an exoplanet. Simply select the planet you want to travel to and watch the stars around you…

We took part in the NASA Space Apps Hackathon in Nuremberg. On our journey to the exoplanets Uwe H. stepped at our side and joined the team.

Kudos to the organizers of the event @Oliver Nießlein and @Silke Steffan from https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/2024-local-events/nuremberg/

We will be back next year if we make it back from our exoplanets…
