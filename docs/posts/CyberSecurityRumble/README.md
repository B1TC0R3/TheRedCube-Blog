# CyberSecurityRumble

We had a great time at the CyberSecurityRumble, a CTF organized by TheRedRocket in Bonn, Germany. It was great for us to spend the whole weekend working together on CTF Challenges from all categories.

It was great to have no limits on the participants, which allowed us to have a lot of students joining the team and working for the first time on a CTF challenge. This was a great opportunity. We had up to 21 participants at the university to work together on all types of challenges.

Together, we made it to place 39 out of over 264 participating teams.
