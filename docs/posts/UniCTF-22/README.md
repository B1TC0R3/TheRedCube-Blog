# HTB University CTF 2022

The 2022 university CTF was a great event for us. We also participated in the university CTF 2021. This year, we were able to expand our team from 10 to 30 people.

We had many new participants on the team who were trying out working on CTF challenges as a team.

It was a great time spent over a weekend full of pizza, soft drinks, and code.

We joined the CTF under the name **Hochschule MÃ¼nchen** as only universities are allowed to participate, and we managed to reach 65th place out of 328 participating teams.
