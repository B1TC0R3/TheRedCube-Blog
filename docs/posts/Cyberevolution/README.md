# Cyberevolution CTF

Cyberevolution was our first CTF, and we did not participate online but on-site. It was a great opportunity for us to attend the convention, learn about Cybersecurity trends, and network with peers and companies in the field. We had a fantastic time, and we want to thank the organizers for the invitation.

It was also great to meet the other teams from various companies and universities. It was a blast.

The CTF took place in Frankfurt, Germany. We secured the 6th position out of 14 participating teams.
