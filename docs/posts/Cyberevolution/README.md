# Cyberevolution CTF

Cyberevolution was our first CTF where we did not participate online, but participated on-site. Cyberevolution was a great opportunity for us to join the convention, learn about Cybersecurity trends, and network with peers and companies in the field. It was a fantastic time, and we want to thank the organizers for the invitation.

It was also great to meet the other teams from various companies and universities. It was a blast.

The CTF took place in Frankfurt, Germany. We secured the 6th position out of 14 participating teams.
